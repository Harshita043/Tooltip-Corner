# Tooltip Corner

Tooltips are a common user interface element that provides additional information when you hover over an element, such as a button. In this tutorial, we'll create a reusable tooltip component that can be positioned in four different ways: "top," "bottom," "right,"
 and "left."

## Features

- The example renders four buttons, each with an onClick function that updates the placement state to the corresponding position.
- The Tooltip component is rendered with the placement state as its placement prop.
- When the user hover on the button, the tooltip appears with the placement set by the user.
- The component uses Bootstrap classes for styling and positioning of the elements.
  

## Getting Started

- Install the dependencies by running npm install or yarn install.
- Start the development server by running npm start or yarn start.
- The example should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Dependencies

- React
- Bootstrap

## Tips To add additional features
- Animation: Add smooth animations to the tooltip for a more polished look. You can use CSS transitions or a library like react-transition-group for this purpose.
- Delay: Implement a delay before showing or hiding the tooltip when hovering over or moving away from the target element. This can prevent the tooltip from flickering when users quickly move their mouse.
- Custom Styling: Allow users to customize the tooltip's styling by passing additional CSS classes or styles as props.
-  Arrow Indicator: Add an arrow indicator that points to the target element, making it clear which element the tooltip is associated with.
-   Tooltip Trigger Events: Allow users to choose whether the tooltip should appear on hover, click, or any other custom event.

## Conclusion

- This is a simple example of how to use a tooltip in a React application and change its placement based on user interaction. It should serve as a good starting point for your own project.
